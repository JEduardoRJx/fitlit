## Introduction
FitLit is the second project but first parter project of Module 2 at Turing. Our instructos gave us this [FitLit spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html) sheet with different iterations to complete. For our project we had to use semantic HTML, CSS, and a number of JavaScript folders and files. Our data folder contains all the data we need, our source folder contains our classes and our script.js that handles our functinality, and our test folder that contains all our tests.

## Learning Goals
* Follow the specification below to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods
* Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Overview
With Fitlit we're given data from an activity tracker for different users over a number of days. Fitlit logs the data and presents it on a dashboard for our users. Our goal is to present a useful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.
